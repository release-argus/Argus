Argus will query websites at a user defined interval for new software releases and then trigger Gotify/Slack/Other notification(s) and/or WebHook(s) when one has been found.
For example, you could set it to monitor the Argus repo ([release-argus/argus](https://github.com/release-argus/Argus)). This will query the [GitHub API](https://api.github.com/repos/release-argus/argus/releases) and track the "tag_name" variable. When this variable changes from what it was on a previous query, a GitHub-style WebHook could be sent that triggers something (like AWX) to update Argus on your server.

## Building from source

### Prerequisites

The backend of Argus is built with [Go](https://go.dev/), and the frontend with [React](https://reactjs.org/). The React frontend is built and then [embedded](https://pkg.go.dev/embed) into the Go binary so that those web files can be served.

- [Go 1.24+](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [NodeJS 22](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Go changes

To see the changes you've made by modifying any of the `.go` files, you must compile Argus. Run `make build` the first time to ensure the web components are available locally. Any future builds that don't need the web-ui to be rebuilt can be done with `make go-build` (faster than `make build`). (Running either of these in the root dir will produce an `argus` binary)

### React changes

To see the changes after modifying anything in `web/ui/react-app`, you must recompile both the Go backend and the React frontend. This can be done by running `make build`. (Running this in the root dir will produce the `argus` binary)

## Getting started

To get started with Argus, simply download the binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/release-argus/Argus/releases), and set up the config for that binary.

For further help, check out the [Getting Started](https://release-argus.io/docs/getting-started/) page on our website.

### Config formatting

The config can be broken down into 5 key areas. ([Further help](https://release-argus.io/docs/config/))

- [defaults](https://release-argus.io/docs/config/defaults/) - This is broken down into areas with defaults for [services](https://release-argus.io/docs/config/defaults/#service-portion), [notify](https://release-argus.io/docs/config/defaults/#notify-portion) and [webhooks](https://release-argus.io/docs/config/defaults/#webhook-portion).
- [settings](https://release-argus.io/docs/config/settings/) - Settings for the Argus server.
- [service](https://release-argus.io/docs/config/service/) - A dictionary mapping of all the services to monitor as well as what to notify when a new release is found.
- [notify](https://release-argus.io/docs/config/notify/) - A dictionary mapping of targets for Notify messages.
- [webhook](https://release-argus.io/docs/config/webhook/) - A dictionary mapping of targets for WebHooks.
